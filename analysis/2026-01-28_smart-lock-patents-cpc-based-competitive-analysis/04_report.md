## Q2: Technology Focus Areas

### Technology Distribution (by title keywords)

| Technology | Patents | Trend |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Electronic/Digital | 28 | Core technology, steady |
| Vehicle Access | 21 | Growing - automotive crossover |
| Access Control Systems | 16 | Enterprise/commercial focus |
| Biometric | 3 | Surprisingly low in granted patents |
| Mobile/Wireless | 3 | Integration happening at system level |

### Key Observations

1. **Electronic mechanisms dominate** - The core innovation is in electromechanical lock mechanisms, not software
2. **Vehicle access is significant** - Toyota, Rivian, and others have substantial lock-related IP (21 patents)
3. **Biometric adoption slower than expected** - Only 3 biometric-specific patents in CPC E05B47
4. **Mobile/wireless at system level** - Connectivity patents may be in different CPC classes (H04W)
